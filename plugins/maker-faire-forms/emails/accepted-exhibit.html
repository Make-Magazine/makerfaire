					<p>Dear $contact_first_name,</p>
					<p>We are happy to inform you that your proposal for Maker Faire, #$post_id - $project_name, has been accepted. We're looking forward to having you participate in the 4th Annual World Maker Faire New York 2013.</p>
					<p>Your support and involvement in the event is so important to the Maker community, and we thank you in advance for bringing your project, enthusiasm, and Maker spirit to the event. Maker Faire celebrates the best of human imagination and creativity, and we expect that our sixteenth Maker Faire will be no different. We want to make sure that we prepare you in advance and get you ready for a great experience. Outlined below, please find key information to help you plan.</p>
					<p>As you begin to prepare, be sure to save the dates September 21st and 22nd for Maker Faire! You should also plan on coming to set up on Friday, September 20th and join us in the late afternoon for networking, a Maker Happy Hour, and our traditional Maker Paella Dinner prepared by Gerard. It is an opportunity to meet other makers and have some fun before the event begins. We will send you an invite with details, as we get closer to the event.</p>
					<p>Second, begin to prepare your exhibit. I encourage you to think about ways to design your space to be educational, interactive, and fun. If you have any questions about your exhibit or changes to it, please reference our new <a href="http://makerfaire.com/new-york-2013/maker-toolkit/">Maker Toolkit</a>.</p>
					<p>Third, review the <a href="http://makezine.com/go/wmfny13-maker-manual/">Maker Manual</a>, which will help you prepare for Maker Faire. In the upcoming weeks, we will send you Maker Newsletters with important information to guide you along and, an email confirming your exhibit details with a link to your Participation Agreement. Accepting this agreement indicates that you have read the Maker Manual and that we have agreed on the specifics of your exhibit.</p>
					<p>Safety Plans: Help us produce a fun and safe environment for all. If your exhibit requires Safety Team, or Fire Marshal approval (you know who you are), please submit your Safety Plan by August 12th. The Safety Plan form is located on the <a href="http://makerfaire.com/new-york-2013/maker-toolkit/">Maker Toolkit</a>. If you received this letter after August 12th, please submit your plan asap.
