SUMMARY:Building 3D Stroboscopic Zoetropes with Hudzo
DTSTART:20170520T173000
DTEND:20170520T180000
DESCRIPTION:Kinetic sculptor, Peter Hudson, takes the zoetrope, a primitive form of animation, to an an extreme level, incorporating creativity, art, engineering, technology, and fantasy into his delightfully captivating designs. Zoetropes contain a series of images that, when rotated, appear to come to life on their own. Peter works alongside engineers, animators, artists, and enthusiastic volunteers to design and build larger-than-life zoetropes, taking the art form from the 19th to the 21st Century. Join Peter Hudson in person to learn more about how he makes these creations come to life - sometimes scaling larger than 32 feet in height.
